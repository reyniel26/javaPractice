Review Java Basics:
- Refresh your understanding of basic Java syntax, data types, variables, and operators.
- Review control structures such as if-else statements, loops (for, while), and switch statements.
- Familiarize yourself with concepts like classes, objects, methods, and constructors.

Notes:
- The file name should be the same of class name.
    - Example: `Main.java` , the class name should be **Main**
    -   ```
        public class Main {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                System.out.println("Hello World");
            }
        }
        ```

- run `javac <filename.java>` to compile file then run `java Classname` to run it

- The String in java is always enclosed to double qoutes
